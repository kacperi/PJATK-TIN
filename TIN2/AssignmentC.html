                <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix" target="blank"> Joaquin Phoenix </a> surprises fans at Joker screenings on opening weekend. Now that the much-hyped Todd Phillips film has been widely released, fans and skeptics alike have been making their way to cinemas in order to see for themselves if the film meets expectations. </p>
                <p> A lot has taken place between the early days when DC announced they would be making a standalone Joker film, and the eventual completion of the project. Before a single screening of Joker had occurred, there were plenty of rumours regarding the quality and power of Phoenix’s portrayal of struggling stand up comedian Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Phoenix lost a staggering amount of weight for the role, fans learned that the story told in Joker wouldn’t take anything from the comic books, and at long last Warner Bros. revealed that the film would have an R-rating. Joker struck gold at its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, ultimately winning the festival’s highest honour - the Golden Lion. But it wasn’t long afterward that controversy over Joker's violence and troubling interpretations of its message began. </p>

                    <h2 class="title"> James Bond Suits Up In First Poster For No Time To Die </h2>
                </div>
                
                <div class="article">
                    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond" target="blank"> James Bond </a> suits up for his next mission in the first poster for No Time to Die. The 25th installment in the long-running action franchise, No Time to Die had a rather tumultuous path to the big screen. Original director Danny Boyle dropped out due to creative differences with the studio, which in turn led to the script being rewritten. Fortunately, when Cary Fukunaga stepped in to take control of the project, things settled down. The producers are apparently so pleased with how Bond 25 turned out, they're already trying to recruit No Time to Die co-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge to pen the script for Bond 26. </p>
                    <p> Admittedly, this is not the most visually engaging or creative poster, but that's fine. Its job is merely to signal the beginning of marketing and alert casual moviegoers a new James Bond film is on the way. Hopefully, there will be more striking one-sheets revealed in the coming months leading up to the movie's release. As efficient this one is in conveying its message, there likely aren't many fans eager to hang the No Time to Die poster on their wall. </p>

                    <div class="article">
                        <p> A new Bourne movie is being developed, and it may connect to the Treadstone TV show. After debuting in 2002, the adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel The Bourne Identity proved to be a huge international hit and turned Matt Damon into an action star. </p>
                        <p> In the years that followed, Bourne became a legitimate name in the spy/thriller genre, focusing on exotic locales, lightning-quick action sequences and an engaging mystery that weighed heavily on the mind of the film’s lead character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon" target="blank"> Jason Bourne </a> (Damon). After three films, the last of which arrived in 2007, Damon moved on to other projects and the effect that the Bourne franchise had on similar longstanding spy/thriller franchises (like James Bond and Mission: Impossible) was a substantial one. </p>
